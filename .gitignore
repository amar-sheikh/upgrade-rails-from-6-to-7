#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
rails_six/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
rails_six/log/*
rails_six/tmp/*

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
rails_six/tmp/pids/*

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
rails_six/storage/*
rails_six/node_modules
rails_six/public/assets
rails_six/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
rails_six/config/master.key
